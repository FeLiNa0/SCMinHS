A Basic Scheme Implementation in Haskell

Followed most of [Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours). New crazy monadic code for programming primitives. Also check out the implementation of dynamically typed numbers, for this I used a complicated typeclass instance of Num.
